# House Price Prediction
# Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices using the Boston Housing Dataset. The dataset contains various features such as crime rate, number of rooms, and accessibility to highways, which are used to train a machine learning model. The XGBoost algorithm is chosen for its effectiveness in regression tasks and handling complex datasets like the Boston dataset.
# Dataset Description: 
The Boston Housing Dataset is a well-known dataset in machine learning and contains 506 samples with 13 numerical features. These features are used to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes.
neumerical features of dataset are: 
1) Per capita crime rate
2) No of bed rooms
3) Age of a person going to occupy
